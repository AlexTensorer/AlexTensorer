## Current Learning
Continual learning is an important part of my personality . Here are some of the things I'm currently learning:

### Ali's Kitchen

I am an absolute foodie so first project I wanted to work on was a recipe sharing website, where people can create an account and submit their favorite recipes! I made this with HTML, custom CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, EJS and Postgres for the relational database. Here's a quick snippet but you can find the projet repo below!
