## About Me
Hi there! I'm Alex, a passionate learner looking for a role as a Fullstack Web Developper.

## Interests

- **Web Development**: I enjoy creating interactive and visually appealing websites using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Data Science**: I'm fascinated by the power of data and its potential to drive insights and decision-making. I'm currently exploring data visualization techniques on [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/#data-visualization-with-d3)

## Current Learning
Continual learning is an important part of my personality. Here are some of the things I'm currently learning:

- **React.js**: I specialised in backend development during my bootcamp so I'm diving deep into React.js to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Java**: In really high demand in my region, I am learning Java via a course on Udemy, exposing me to a OOP language.
- **Git and GitHub**: I'm mastering version control and collaborative workflows using Git and GitHub.

### Ali's Kitchen

I am an absolute foodie so the first project I wanted to work on was a recipe sharing website, where people can create an account and submit their favorite recipes! I made this with HTML, custom CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, EJS and Postgres for the relational database. Here's a quick snippet but you can find the projet repo below!
